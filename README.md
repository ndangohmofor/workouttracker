# workouttracker
Track your workouts and gym visits to keep healthy<br>

This app is the springboot and react version of a project that I completed in bootcamp with pure java and jsp.<br>
The original project can be viewed in this repo: https://github.com/ndangohmofor/final-capstone<br>
Of course, while rebuilding this app, I have added a couple of new features and enhancements now that I have time to work on it at my leisure<br>

This is the backend to the workout tracker app. This backend is built with springboot and postgres.<br>
The email service is implemented to be non-blocking using kafka messaging.
